Project title
Developer game, a game of choice where you play as a software developer looking for a job. you have 3 attributes ( social presence, knowledge, and money) to maintain, in order to reach your goal of finding a job! You are presented each week with a different card granting you two options. each of the two options has a direct effect on your 3 values. for example, one option may give you more money, but lose social presence the goal of the game is to wisely make your decisions so that by the end of you have a high enough value in all 3 to pass your interview and get the job! If one of your values is too low you will not get the job, and lose the game.

Motivation
This is a project for my GA course and the game is based off an existing game called "reigns" on mobile where the user plays as a kind and is given choices throughout their reign. This game has a fun twist to it where i implemented you are playing as a software developer, dealing with modern problems faced on the way to earning a job.
